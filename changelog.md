1.4.3:
Cata:
New stuff:
- Added scale sliders for Player, Target and Focus frames.
- Added "Name inside" option for bigger healthbars setting.

Bugfixes & Tweaks:
- Changed default TargetToT and FocusToT positions to be identical to default Cataclysm values (had retail values). Had to reset values because of this.
- Fixed darkmode not applying to focus tot
- Fixed hide aggro highlight setting to work with the multiple types of raid/party frames.

Retail:
- Shortened ToT name so it does not go outside of the frame texture.

Cataclysm 1.4.1e:
- Fixed logic with target/focus auras messing up with eachother after port from retail to cata.
- Fixed Name Bg setting on Player to only be the actual size of the name bg so color behind hp/mana doesnt get changed
- Fixed Player name to be above Leatrix Plus' version of Name Bg.
