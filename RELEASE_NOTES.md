# BetterBlizzFrames 1.8.9d
## Midnight/Prepatch
### Bugfix
- Fix lua errors from now new restrictions from Blizzard related to castbar types (uninterruptible status).
    This means currently not possible to color/texture an uninterruptible cast without some sort of wonky workaround maybe.
    Disabled for now and will just color depending on cast/channel, this may be confusing on uninterruptible casts.
    Consider disabling castbar color/texture and for now until maybe a solution arrives.
